1. Point to one if/else you avoided in Order by introducing PaymentStrategy?

There you need to be if/else statemnts for swithcing between tyoes of payment.
for e.g if paymentType = cash do this, if paymentType = card do this, if paymentType = voucher do this, etc...

2. Show how the same Order can be paid by different strategies without changing Order code?

Use .pay on same order but using different payment strategies
System.out.println("Customer uses cash:");
order1.pay(new CashPayment());

System.out.println("Customer switches to card:");
order1.pay(new CardPayment("1234567812341234"));

System.out.println("Customer switches to wallet:");
order1.pay(new WalletPayment("alice-wallet-01"));
